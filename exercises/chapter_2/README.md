# Excercise 2 - Logger Function - v1.0

This is your first Node APP
![](../../assets/congrats.gif)

### What to do?
You need to create a logger function that does the following:
- should be a function
- should receive parameters to print
- should append the [date]() (as a readable string)  to the message
- should be called from another function that [takes arguments from the command line](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4351521/how-do-i-pass-command-line-arguments-to-a-node-js-program) and pass them to the logger

Your folder structure should look like this:
```
chapter_2
----|_ app
-------|_ app.js
```

The app should be run like this:
```bash
node app.js --msg="Demo MSG"
```
