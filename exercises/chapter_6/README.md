# Excercise 5 - Testing

### What to do?
First create a folder called `testing_example` here and push that app you should have made while reading the material.

__Yes, if you didn't do it you have to go back and fix that.__

Then, let's integrate testing to our previous excercise:
- Install sinon as stubs/mocks tool
- Install mockery as dependencies patcher
- Create tests for at least 1 entire resource (yes, that's routes, controller and actions)

### Bonus
- Integrate Istanbul to get some code coverage.
- Try to get at least 80% of coverage on the resource you've tested.

### Super Bonus
Give a full 80% coverage on the whole app (yes, test __everything__)
